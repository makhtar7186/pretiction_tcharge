- [x] Refactor the prediction loop logic into a function that can be called on demand
- [x] Create a /predict endpoint that triggers the prediction function and returns the prediction results as JSON
- [x] Optionally add a root endpoint for health check
- [x] Provide instructions to run the FastAPI app with uvicorn
